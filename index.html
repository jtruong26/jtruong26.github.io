								<p>Stuent Learning Outcomes</p>
								<h3 class="major">Organizational Design</h3>
								<p>In project 1, I practiced my research skills by doing extensive primary and secondary research on the skateboard and the ollie itself. For the primary research, I got on my skateboard and rode around for while and then I started practicing the ollie over and over until it was ready for presentation. Youtube played a big role in my secondary research as I looked over several other ollying videos as well as general skateboarding videos to observe the style. Such style is very centered on entertainment with music moving the momentum of the video. By adapting this style to my purpose, I wanted to show that doing an ollie is simple and only takes some practice to be able to do a functional ollie.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Written Communication</h3>
								<p>During project 1, I learned about how style can affect purpose, as for the project I needed to take a professional perspective and be professional with my style which was difficult at moments because I like to ramble off. While recording I had to focus on avoiding the words “um” or “and yeah.” The grammar had to be revised several times for understandability. To reinforce ideas, I also added a small amount of text to supplement the vocal aspect of the video.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Visual Communication</h3>
								<p>The foundation of the visual communication came down to getting the right camera angle. I had multiple takes in different angles to find the one that would best display the techniques I was trying to teach. I had to use a wide angle since I wanted to show the skateboard as well as myself performing the trick. For title pages and text in general I had to consider how the text would balance out with the rest of the visuals, making sure not to put too much or not enough focus on the text depending on the information and part of the video.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Project Planning</h3>
								<p>While completing research and composing drafts for Project 2, I mapped out what my project would look like and made sure I had all of the key pieces of the project, such as getting all the tweets together or completing the complaint letter as well as the response letter in the proper format. Given the lifecycle of my document, which is similar to that of  project 1, I turned in a draft to be reviewed by my peers. They give advice on what type of background information to add, such as the fact that this was not the first ad from Dove that was racially offensive, as well as the suggestion to add more hashtags. After more review and correction, the document was ready to end the cycle.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Project Analysis</h3>
								<p>A main part of the of the research included identifying the readers and focusing the tone of the letters as well as tweets, keeping a professional tone, especially when writing a letter from Dove’s side. My first draft did not have any logic based arguments so I had to add more techniques such as the if you believe this than you believe that tactic when I talked about how if they believe in the beauty of all races, why was there no mention of the third woman in the ad and how the depictions could have affected her or anyone of her culture. The letter was for a company, so I included the appropriate addresses and all other parts of the letter such as the return address, signature, and contact information. To provide full context, I mention Dove’s responses to previous complaints.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Content Development</h3>
								<p>While developing the complaint letter as well as the response letter, I fulfilled all requirements of a letter, such as the return address, the address of the company, a proper introduction, as well as a closing signature and contact information. The introduction of the letter was short and got to the subject of the body quickly. I divided the body into three main topics, to give information and make an attempt to persuade the company. To close I provided a conclusion which repeated the initial subject and purpose.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Reflection</h3>
								<p>For my Project 1 in English 2210, I created an instructional video on how to perform the ollie. The purpose of this was to teach users how to perform an ollie efficiently and safely. To complete this task, I showed a step-by-step process of the ollie and explained why each step was important. To emphasize the steps, I shortened them down to four steps and showed them typed-up on the screen just in case they were not clear.
									I knew my audience was going to be full of people who are mostly under twenty-five. In this age-group, most people are extensively familiar with technology and youtube would be their primary source for a “how-to.” The ollie is an introductory trick, so the people who would be using my video beginners who do not have much experience skateboarding. Taking other experience-levels into consideration, as well as the people who will evaluate my video, I also added small yet more advanced tips that are important but often forgotten.
									When I first started my project, I had not been on my skateboard for years. I was basically a beginner and had to relearn the ollie. This took hours of getting used to being on the board again and doing the ollie over and over until my shoelaces were ripped off my shoes. However, once I started to get it down again, the project became much more enjoyable.</p>
